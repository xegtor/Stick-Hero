## Introduction
Stick Hero is fun and intuitive game designed to show how JavaFX can be used to create a game using OOP 's principals as well as various Design Patterns and using good coding practices in general.

## Game Mechanics and Tutorial
1. First, on starting the game the user is greeted with a pleasant start screen with a play button.
2. After pressing the play button you are greeted with a map section screen after which you can begin the game.
3. In the game you spawn at a platform and the objective is to reach the next platform without falling into the gap in between them.
4. When you are on a platform you can hold the mouse button to generate a stick whose length is proportional to the duration of the mouse hold.
5. Whilst traversing the stick you can flip to collect cherries on the bottom side of the stick however if you crash into a platform you die.
6. Once you die and reach the death screen you are presented between two options.
7. This allows you to either revive if you have more than 2 cherries else you can return to the home screen.

**Note: Please do not spam click inputs and wait patiently for the game to respond(there might be some slow responsiveness due to different hardware configurations)**
